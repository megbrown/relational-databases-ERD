# relational-databases-ERD

1. Download the [musichistory.db](./assets/musichistory.db) file, and then copy it to the folder that you created for this exercise. That file **is** the database. It contains all of the tables and data.
2. Install our Database Browser - there are tons out there, but let's use [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
3. Open then Database Browser and click 'open database' - select the file you just downloaded
4. Glimpse through the tables and see if you can get a sense of how on earth they are related.
5. Let's use one of these tools to create an ERD and see if we can't get a better sense of how these tables are related:
